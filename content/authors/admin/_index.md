I'm a Post Doctoral Scholar at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/)  in the [Robotics Embedded Systems Lab (RESL)](http://robotics.usc.edu/resl/) under supervision of Prof. [Gaurav Sukhatme](http://www-robotics.usc.edu/~gaurav/). Prior to joining USC, I finished my PhD at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) in the [Autonomous Collective System Lab (ACS)](http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/acs/) under supervision of [Dr. Spring Berman](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/1943720). While at ASU, I worked on developing strategies for mapping environmental features of interest – specifically obstacles, collision-free paths, generating a metric map and estimating scalar density fields– in an unknown domain using data obtained by a swarm of resource constrained robots. Currently at RESL, I'm mostly involved with the development of mathematical models of sub-network failures, e.g., how the failure of one agent leads to a whole sub-network failure, and the design of reliable topologies which mitigates the effects of the failure on the team task performance. However, I have very broad interests in the fields of multi-robot systems, control theory and applied differential geometry. More recently, I have been investigating the application of differential geometry and manifold learning on motion planning. I have evaluated my work on many different platforms such as [Crazyfiles](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/), [Turtlebot3 Burger](http://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3/) and [Pheeno](https://acslaboratory.github.io/).

Before joining ASU, I studied Civil Engineering at [National institue of Technology Calicut (NITC)](http://www.nitc.ac.in/). In May 2011, I graduated from NITC obtaining a Bachelor of Technology degree. I worked at [Gammon India](http://www.gammonindia.com/home/gammon-india.htm) for a few months after obtaining my undergraduate degree in Civil engineering.
