A heterogeneous multi-robot team, where robots have varied sensing, actuation, communication and computational capabilities, is a promising direction to consider when building a resilient team. Such a team can work together by sharing resources  between  individual  robots  to  perform  complex tasks, thereby being resilient to failures of individual robots.For  example,  when  a  particular  sensor  on  a  robot  fails,  it may be able to rely on measurements made by a teammate nearby. If  the  team  is  to  perform  its  task  by  sharing  resources between team members, it is desirable to configure the team with  a  communication  topology  such  that  each  robot  has access  to  its  teammates’  resources  (e.g.,  sensing,  computation)  within  some  neighborhood.  Under  distance-limited communication,  specifying  such  a  topology  restricts  the feasible set of the robots’ physical locations
