A heterogeneous multi-robot team, where robots have varied sensing, actuation, communication and computational capabilities, is a promising direction to consider when building a resilient team. Such a team can work together by sharing resources  between  individual  robots  to  perform  complex tasks, thereby being resilient to failures of individual robots. We exploit this idea in this project.
