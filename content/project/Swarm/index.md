Robotic swarms can potentially perform complicated tasks such as exploration
and mapping at large space and time scales in a parallel and robust fashion. This
project aims at developing strategies for mapping environmental features of interest – specifically
obstacles, collision-free paths, generating a metric map and estimating scalar
density fields– in an unknown domain using data obtained by a swarm of resource-constrained
robots.
