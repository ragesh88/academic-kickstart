# TODO give detailed description below

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the development of robot platforms that can be deployed in swarms to perform tasks autonomously over large
spatial and temporal scales. In addition, swarms of nanoscale structures and devices
such as nanoparticles, molecular machines, and magnetic nanocarriers are being developed for biomedical applications such as imaging and targeted drug delivery.

# TODO complete the above
