The goal of this seminar course is to provide an intuitive understanding of various abstract mathematical concepts commonly used in robotics without diving deep into the technical details associated with them. Also, various robotics applications of the concepts will be discussed throughout the course. Topics to be covered include basic real analysis, coordinate free linear algebra, dynamical systems, optimization/optimal control, topology and differential geometry.
