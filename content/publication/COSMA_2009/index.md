abstract: "This paper proposes a new target locating
algorithm for detecting the weld pattern from a digital
photograph and thus providing the approximate location
of the weld for robotic end effector to perform various
operations like cleaning, grinding etc. This reduces the
human intervention and improves the quality of the work.
Implementing this algorithm reduces computational
complexities and can be easily adapted to the generally
available automation system. In the present work, camera
captures the image and MATLAB image processing
toolbox is used to perform auto segmentation. The output
of this algorithm is the approximate position coordinates
of the weld strip. Algorithm is found effective for rough
terrained weld image strips where normal edge detection
and enhancing techniques fail usually."
