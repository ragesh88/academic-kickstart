 abstract = {This paper presents an approach to mapping a region of interest using ob-
servations from a robotic swarm without localization. The robots have local sensing
capabilities and no communication, and they exhibit stochasticity in their motion.
We model the swarm population dynamics with a set of advection-diffusion-reaction
partial differential equations (PDEs). The map of the environment is incorporated
into this model using a spatially-dependent indicator function that marks the pres-
ence or absence of the region of interest throughout the domain. To estimate this in-
dicator function, we define it as the solution of an optimization problem in which we
minimize an objective functional that is based on temporal robot data. The optimiza-
tion is performed numerically offline using a standard gradient descent algorithm.
Simulations show that our approach can produce fairly accurate estimates of the
positions and geometries of different types of regions in an unknown environment.},
