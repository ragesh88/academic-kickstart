abstract: "Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a  level-set  function  of  the  constraint  suitable  for  integration  into  a  constrained sampling-based motion planner.  Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points.  We evaluate ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities ofconstraint manifolds, the impact of its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner. "
