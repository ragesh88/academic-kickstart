abstract: "Pursuit-Evasion Game (PEG) consists of a team
of pursuers trying to capture one or more evaders. PEGs
are important due to its application in surveillance, search
and rescue, disaster robotics, boundary defense and so on.
But, in general, PEG requires exponential time to compute
the minimum number of pursuers to capture an evader. To
mitigate this, we have design a parallel optimal algorithm to
minimize the capture time in PEG. Given a discrete topology,
this algorithm also outputs the minimum number of pursuers to
capture an evader. Our new algorithm enable us to investigate
larger topologies. A classic example of PEG is the popular
arcade game Pac-Man. Although Pac-Man topology has almost
300 nodes, our algorithm can handle this. We show that Pac-
Man is overkill, i.e., given the Pac-Man game topology, Pac-
Man game contains more pursuers/ghosts (four) than it is
necessary (two) to capture evader/Pac-man. We also extend the
algorithm to consider different speeds. we also extended the
algorithm to increase evader survival in a game. We evaluate
these algorithms for many different topologies."
