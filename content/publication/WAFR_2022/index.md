abstract: When is heterogeneity in the composition of an autonomous robotic team beneficial and when is it detrimental? We investigate and answer this question in the context of a minimally viable model that examines the role of heterogeneous speeds in perimeter defense problems, where defenders share a total allocated speed budget. We consider two distinct problem settings and develop strategies based on dynamic programming and on local interaction rules. We present a theoretical analysis of both approaches and our results are extensively validated using simulations. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the viability of heterogeneous teams depends on the amount of information available to the defenders. Moreover, our results suggest a universality property across a wide range of problem parameters the optimal ratio of the speeds of the defenders remains nearly constant.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We consider a scenario where a team of robots is tasked with protecting region of interest from external intruders.
